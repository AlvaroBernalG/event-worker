# event-worker 
> Minimalistic event/promified driven web worker abstraction.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/event-worker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/event-worker) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/event-worker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/event-worker) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```
$ npm install event-worker --save
```

## Usage 

In your main thread (main.js): 

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker({src: 'path/to/my/worker.js'})

let result = await worker.emit('getUserById', {id: '30242'})

/*
{
  id: '30242',
  name: 'neil',
  lastname: 'tyson degrasse'
}
*/

```

And then in your web worker (worker.js) you can listen for that event and respond back with the data requested by your main thread:

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('getUserById', async ({payload, resolve})=> {

  let user = await getUSer('id', payload.id) 

  resolve(user) // Respond back to the main thread with the data requested.
})
```

Instead of embedding the library to the worker with a module bundler, you can use the built in function `importScripts` from your web worker like so:

```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

// ...

```

#### Error Handling
Error handling works the same as you would expect from a promise executed on the same thread:

From main thread (main.js):

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker({src: 'path/to/my/worker.js'})

worker.emit('rejectThisCall')
  .catch((reason)=> { 
    console.log('Rejected because: "${reason}" ')
  })

```

From worker (worker.js):
```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('rejectThisCall', ({reject})=> {
  reject('I am bad..')
})

//throwing errors
worker.on('rejectThisCall', ()=> {
  throw new Error()
})

// throwing async errors 
worker.on('rejectThisCallAsync', async ()=> {
  throw new Error() 
})
```

#### Workload splitting

If you want to keep your main thread running smoothly dividing the work load of expensive computational task between multiple web workers becomes trivial and fun. 

From main thread (main.js):
```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker') 

const workerOpts = {src: 'path/to/my/worker.js'}

const workerPool = [
  new EventWorker(workerOpts),
  new EventWorker(workerOpts),
  new EventWorker(workerOpts)
] 

const sum = (a, b) => a + b

const multiplyBy2InOtherThread = (worker, number) => worker.emit('multiply_by_2', number)

(await Promise.all(
  workerPool.map(multiplyBy2InOtherThread)
)).reduce(sum, 0) // 6

```
From worker (worker.js):
```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const EventWorker = require('event-worker') 

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('multiply_by_2', ({payload, resolve})=>{
  const multipliedByTwo = payload * 2
  resolve(multipliedByTwo) 
})

```

## API

#### new EventWorker(options) `EventWorker`

Creates a new instance 
  * options `object`
    * options.src 

      Path or source of the web worker. If no src is passed, it will assume that the environment is a web worker. 



#### emit(eventName, data) `Promise`

Emits a event.
  * eventName `String`

  * data `Any`


#### on(eventName, callback) `void`

Listens for an event. 

* eventName

* callback `function(object) => void`

  Gets executed when eventName is emited.

  * object 
    * object.payload `any`

      Data that was sent from the event emitter to the listener. 
      
    * object.resolve  `function`

      Function that allows the listerner to respond back the original event emitter.

    * object.reject  `function`

      Function that allows the listener to reject the call.
