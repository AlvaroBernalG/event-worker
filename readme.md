# event-worker 
> Minimalistic event/promified driven web worker abstraction.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/event-worker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/event-worker) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/event-worker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/event-worker) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```
$ npm install event-worker --save
```

## Usage 

In your main thread (main.js): 
```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker({src: 'path/to/my/worker.js'})

let result = await worker.emit('getUserById', {id: '30242'})

/*
{
  id: '30242',
  name: 'neil',
  lastname: 'tyson degrasse'
}
*/

```

And then in your web worker (worker.js) you could do something like:

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('getUserById', async ({payload, resolve})=> {

  let user = await getUSer('id', payload.id) 

  resolve(user) // Respond back to the main thread with the data requested.
})
```

You can also use the built in function `importScripts` from your web worker to import the library like so:

```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

// ...

```

#### Error Handling
Error handling works the same as you would expect from a promise:

From main thread (main.js):

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker({src: 'path/to/my/worker.js'})

worker.emit('rejectThisCall')
  .catch((reason)=> { 
    console.log('Rejected because: "${reason}" ')
  })
  // Rejected because: "I am bad.."

```

From worker (worker.js):
```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('rejectThisCall', ({reject})=> {
  reject('I am bad..')
})

worker.on('rejectThisCall', ({reject})=> {
  throw new Error() // it also catches thrown errors.
})

```

#### Workload splitting

If you want to keep your main thread running smoothly dividing the work load of expensive computational task between multiple web workers becomes trivial and fun. 

From main thread (main.js):
```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker') 

const workerOpts = {src: 'path/to/my/worker.js'}

const workerPool = [
  new EventWorker(workerOpts),
  new EventWorker(workerOpts),
  new EventWorker(workerOpts)
] 

const sum = (a, b) => a + b

const multiplyBy2InOtherThread = (worker, number) => worker.emit('multiply_by_2', number)

(await Promise.all(
  workerPool.map(multiplyBy2InOtherThread)
)).reduce(sum, 0) // 6

```
From worker (worker.js):
```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const EventWorker = require('event-worker') 

const worker = new EventWorker()


worker.on('multiply_by_2', ({payload, resolve})=>{
  const multipliedByTwo = payload * 2
  resolve(multipliedByTwo) 
})

```

## API

#### new EventWorker(options) `EventWorker`

Creates a new instance 
  * options `object`
    * options.src 

      Path or source of the web worker. If no src is passed, it will assume that the environment is a web worker. 



#### emit(eventName, data) `Promise`

Emits a event.
  * eventName `String`

  * data `Any`


#### on(eventName, callback) `void`

Listens for an event. 

* eventName

* callback `function(object) => void`

  Gets executed when eventName is emited.

  * object 
    * object.payload `any`

      Data that was sent from the event emitter to the listener. 
      
    * object.resolve  `function`

      Function that allows the listerner to respond back the original event emitter.

    * object.reject  `function`

      Function that allows the listener to reject the call.
