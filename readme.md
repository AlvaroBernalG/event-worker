# event-worker 
> Minimalistic event/promified driven web worker abstraction.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/event-worker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/event-worker) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/event-worker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/event-worker) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```
$ npm install event-worker --save
```


## Warning 
This is a work in progress.

## Usage 

In your main thread (main.js): 

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker('path/to/my/worker.js')

async function getUser(){
  
  let result = await worker.emit('getUserById', {id: '30242'})
  /*
  {
    id: '30242',
    name: 'neil',
    lastname: 'tyson degrasse'
  }
  */
//... 

```

And then in your web worker (worker.js) you can listen for that event and respond back with the data requested by your main thread:

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('getUserById', async ({payload, resolve})=> {

  let user = await getUSer('id', payload.id) 

  resolve(user) // Respond back to the main thread with the data requested.
})

```

Instead of embedding the library in the worker file with a module bundler, you can use the built in function `importScripts` from your web worker like so:

```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

// ...
```
EventWorker reference is injected into the global scope once it is instantiated.


#### Workload splitting

If you want to keep your main thread running smoothly dividing the work load of expensive computational task between multiple web workers becomes trivial and fun. 

From main thread (main.js):

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker') 

const workerPath = 'path/to/my/worker.js'

const workerPool = [
  new EventWorker(workerPath),
  new EventWorker(workerPath),
  new EventWorker(workerPath)
] 

const sum = (a, b) => a + b

const multiplyBy2InOtherThread = (worker, number) => worker.emit('multiply_by_2', number)

(async ()=>
  (await Promise.all(
    workerPool.map(multiplyBy2InOtherThread)
  )).reduce(sum, 0)
)() // 6


```
From worker (worker.js):
```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('multiply_by_2', ({payload, resolve}) => {
  resolve(payload * 2) 
})

```

#### Bidirectional communication

You can listen for events triggered by your workers. Useful if for example you have a long running worker that is continously fetching the web with the expectation of finding something interesting. 

From main thread (main.js):
```js
//...

worker.on('interestingData', ({payload, resolve})=>{
  
  doSomethingWithInterestingData(payload)

  resolve('Good job worker!') 

})

//..
```

From worker (worker.js):
```js
//...

setInterval( async ()=>{

  let data = parseResult((await fetch('http://interesting.news.com')))
  
  if(isInteresting(data)){

    let mainThreadResponse = await worker.emit('interestingData', data)
    //..

  }
}, 1000)
//..

```
#### Inlining code 

Instead of having a separate file for your worker, you can pass a function as an argument to the constructor of EventWorker. A good option for prototyping.

From main (main.js):
```js

const worker = new EventWorker(async (mainThread) => {

  let res = await mainThread.emit('sayingHiFromWorker', 'Hi main thread!')   

  console.log(res) // Hello worker!

})

worker.on('sayingHiFromWorker', ({payload, resolve}) => {

  console.log(payload) // Hi main thread!

  resolve("Hello worker!")

})
```

##### Caveat

When you inline functions it is easy to get confused by the scopes. If you try to access a variable that is outside the scope of the function it will fail. 

```js

const favoriteAnimal = 'chiguire'

const worker = new EventWorker(async (mainThread) => {

  mainThread.on('onGetAnimals', ()=>{

    console.log(favoriteAnimal) // fails. favoriteAnimal variable is not in the same execution scope.

    //...
  })   

})

```

#### Error Handling

Error handling works the same as you would expect from a promise executed in the same thread:

From main thread (main.js):

```js
const EventWorker = require('event-worker')

const worker = new EventWorker('path/to/my/worker.js')

worker.emit('rejectThisCall')
  .catch((reason) => { 
    console.log(`Rejected because: "${reason}" `)
  })

```

From worker (worker.js):
```js
importScripts('path/to/source/event-worker.js')

const worker = new EventWorker()

worker.on('rejectThisCall', ({reject})=> {
  reject('I am bad..')
})

//throwing errors
worker.on('rejectThisCall', () => {
  throw new Error()
})

// throwing async errors 
worker.on('rejectThisCallAsync', async ()=> {
  throw new Error() 
})

```

## API

#### new EventWorker(source) `EventWorker`

Creates a new instance 
  * source `string | function | undefined`

    * If a string is passed: It will assume it is the worker source file path. 

    * If a function is passed it will get converted into a string an then transformed into a worker. 

    * If nothing (undefined) is passed it will assume that the environment is the worker. 



#### emit(eventName, data) `Promise`

Emits a event.
  * eventName `String`

  * data `Any`


#### on(eventName, callback) `void`

Registers  for an event. 

* eventName

* callback `function(object) => void`

  Gets executed when eventName is emited.

  * object 
    * object.payload `any`

      Data sent from the event emitter to the listener. 
      
    * object.resolve  `function`

      Function that allows the listerner to resolve the promise.

    * object.reject  `function`

      Function that allows the listener to reject the promise.
